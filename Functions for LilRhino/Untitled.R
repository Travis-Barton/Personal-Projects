# Bootstrap sampling of individual words in each group of sentences seperated by class. 
# This way we get more data for small sizes


### 1) Turn posts into one hot encodings with data.

### 2) Seperate them by class.

### 3) Label each '1' in each vector with a vector and a placeholder.

### 4) Make a vector of lengths of words.

### 5) Sample each word randomly. The size of each word is also sampled from the 
###    vector made in 4). 

### 6) Profit! (jk but really then you have new data and can test)

### 7) Functionalize it for package.
